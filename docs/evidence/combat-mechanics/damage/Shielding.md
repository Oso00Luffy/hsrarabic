**Finding:**  
Damage reduction effects are applied to the damage dealt to characters before damaging the shield.  
  
**Evidence:**  
tested with We are Wildfire lightcone S2, which reduces incoming damage by 10% for 5 turns.  
The first attack of the guys deals 154 damage to unshielded Fire MC on the first turn, the same attack deals 154 damage to shielded Fire MC, and after 5 turns the same attack deals 171 damage to shielded Fire MC (and 171*0.9 = 154).
